npm i typescript ----- to install ts locally to your Project
tsc --init ----> to set the tsconfig file (configuration of the compiler)

compiler options:
    set "target" to ES2015 or higher
    set "module" to ES2015 or higher (between 2015-2022)
    set "rootDir" to the path of the src folder (were the compiler can get the ts files)
    set "outDir" to the path of the scripts folder (were the compiler can compile the ts files to js files)
    set "noEmitOnError to true (to avoid any compilation while having some errors)
    
    after the main object set another prop called "include" to include the ts files source 
    (an array of paths(strings), currently one path , the src path)

tsc -w =====> activate the watcher based on the compiler configuration, so each time you will write to a ts file
    the compiler will automatically compile the ts files.

if both node and npm properly installed and yet cannot be found ,

Options:
    1. use command prompt.
    2. Use node js command propmt.
    3. Use "npx" before typing any ts command.

if donwnloaded Ben`s code, the code will not contain the "nodeModules" folder,
to solve that just type "npm i" and it will automatically install all required moduels based on the project.

This part is only for Ben`s code, if it is a new project just follow the steps below.
