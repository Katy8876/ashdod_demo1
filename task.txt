For this API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
please fetch all posts using a function called "fetchData", this function will be imported
from a file called "functions" inside a file called "utils"
import the function into a ts file and set a front Project.

Instructions:
display all posts into a html page
use bootstrap to define your css design.
inside each post set a section of comments where a user can comment on the post.
align to the post the time that its got created.

beside posting a comment add a section that tells who is the comment author,
basically 2 inputs one for commen and one for author.

store each post inside the local storage.
store all post`s comments also.

set an antity for liking the post.
each user that likes the post, the number will increase ,
if a user press "like" again it will decrease the likes number by 1.

Hint:
    define the structure of each data storage before start coding!

Advanced level:
    instead of posting each time the author name, set a login proccess so the current author will always
    be remembered!
    not necessarily means to set a html page for login, can be stored inside the posts page itself.
    Please note that, if a user is been logged in so the author input is not required,
    but id not please display the author input!

Use Type script for that exercise!
Good Luck!
